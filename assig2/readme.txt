constants, test cases, how to run program, generate doxygen docs, and view them

This zipfile contains three executable programs called: at, at2, and at3. 

1. The program "at" is meant to demonstrate basic arrays in C. It populates an
integer array of size SAMPLE_INT_ARRAY_SIZE (defined to be 10) with
consecutive integers, as well as a
double array of size SAMPLE_DOUBLE_ARRAY_SIZE (defined to be 5) with
consecutive doubles, then prints
both of the results. The program can be run by typing "make clean", "make",
then "./at" into the terminal command line.

2. The program "at2" is meant to further demonstrate array functionality by
populating an array of integers from command line input. The program will
process command line inputs into an array up until SAMPLE_INT_ARRAY_SIZE
(defined to be 10) 
inputs have been supplied, print the array, sort the array, then print the
resulting array. The program can be run by typing "make clean", "make", then "./at2 <num1> <num2> <num3> etc." into the terminal command line.

3. The program "at3" is meant to demonstrate sorting arrays, and random number
generations. The program will populate an array of size SAMPLE_INT_ARRAY_SIZE
(defined to be 10) with random integers from 0 to MAX_RAND_INT (defined to be
10) inclusive, print the array, then sort the array and print it again.

Test Cases: 

at1: 
  1. Change SAMPLE_INT_ARRAY_SIZE or SAMPLE_DOUBLE_ARRAY_SIZE constants.

at2: 
  1. Input: nothing                  Result: outputs empty array (blank) 
  2. Input: number of elts > size    Result: only processes inputs up to size
  3. Input: number of elts < size    Result: fills remaining slots of array
  4. Input: double values            Result: truncated to integers

  sorting: 
  1. Input: descending order array   Result: prints reverse order 
  2. Input: one value                Result: prints the value
  3. more values than size           Result: prints ascending list

at3: all inputs generated by rand(), each time through change seed.

Doxygen: In order to generate docs for this project type "make docs" into the
command line, then navigate to "users.wpi.edu/~bwolfson/cs2303assig2/ to view
