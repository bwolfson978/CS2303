There were two main parts of assigment 3: making our own C library string functions, and working with structs. The file mystring.c holds all the source code for my own versions of C library string functions such as strdup(), strndup(), strlen(), strcpy(), strncpy(), strcat(), and strncat(). The file executable ctest can be run by first typing "make clean" into the cmd line, then "make", then "./ctest". It will output two big chunks of data with string manipulations explained. The first chunk uses the standard library functions and the second chunk uses my functions. The two outputs are intended to be basically equal to demonstrate expected function behavior. 
	The second part of the assignment can be found in the account.h, and account.c files. These functions revolve around the struct of a bank account with name, account_number, and dollars as it's attributes. There are functions for creating an account from data, creating an account with randomly generated data, populating an array of pointers that all point to account structs, and printing both accounts and arrays of pointers to accounts. There are also two functions: shallow_copy() and deep_copy() for copying arrays of account struct data. These functions can all be seen demonstrated by typing "make clean","make", then "./ctest" into the command line. The latter half of the output is for this section of the assignment. The last function that happens, but may be difficult to see is the deallocate() function which frees the pointers of their struct values.
